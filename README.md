## ðŸ“– Project Overview

Welcome to second part of my **SQL Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** !

This analytics project extends the previous SQL Data Warehouse into an analytics layer to answer real business questions. 

If you haven't seen the [Part 1 of SQL Data Warehouse Project, click here.](https://github.com/faiceps/data-warehouse)

These scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, and more.

This project involves:

**A.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
1.  Database exploration.
2.  Dimensions exploration.
3.  Measures exploration.
4.  Magnitude analysis.
5.  Ranking analysis.

As this SQL analytics project is a work in progress, more **advanced analytics** will be performed, such as:

-  Customer segmentation.
-  Customer report.
-  Product report.

Without further ado, let's get going!
