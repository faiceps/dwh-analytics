## ðŸ“– Project Overview

Welcome to Part 2 of my **SQL Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** !

This analytics project builds on the previous [Data Warehouse Project developed in Part 1](https://github.com/faiceps/data-warehouse), 
extending into a business analytics layer to answer real business questions. 

In this project, I used SQL-based analytics to explore data, build metrics, and deliver actionable insights that mirror real-world BI use cases.

This project involves:

**A.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
1.  Database and schema exploration.
2.  Dimensions exploration.
3.  Date range exploration.
4.  Key measures exploration.
5.  Magnitude analysis.
6.  Ranking analysis.

**B.  Advanced Analytics**
1.  Change over time analysis.
2.  Cumulative analysis.
3.  Performance analysis.

As this SQL analytics project is a work in progress, more **advanced analytics** will be performed, such as:

-  Customer segmentation.
-  Customer report.
-  Product report.

This project demonstrates my ability to transform warehouse data into decision-ready insights. 

It showcases skills in SQL analytics, time-series analysis, KPI definition, and BI reporting logic, which are crucial for building dashboards in Power BI and Fabric.

    TABLE_TYPE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;
```
